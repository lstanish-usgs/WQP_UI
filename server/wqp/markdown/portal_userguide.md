The ***Water Quality Data Portal (WQP)*** provides an easy way to access data stored in three large water quality databases. Input parameters on the [form](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal/) include *location*, *site*, *sampling*, and *date* parameters. The WQP can return ***site information*** (locations where samples were collected), or it can return ***sample results*** (analytical data of collected samples). Any field in the form left blank will cause a search for **all** parameters in that field. 
>*Example:* If a user selects US and California for the *country* and *state* respectively, but leaves the *county* field blank, data will be returned for **all** counties in California. All data will also be returned for the fields under *SITE PARAMETERS* and *SAMPLING PARAMETERS*.

The same input parameters can be used to make data retrievals using web services. For more information and examples on accessing the web services, see the [Web Services Guide](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation/). 

Users less familiar with the standard notation used to encode a web services request may find the form more convenient. In the Advanced form, URL's are automatically generated that reflect the current selections. The URL's can be copied and pasted for sharing or for use in various programming environments.

#### **Available Databases**

**NWIS (USGS)** - Water-resources data collected from approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. NWIS (USGS) is updated every 24 hours. Data recently added to NWIS (USGS) may not be immediately accessible through the WQP. Data are available for each location dating back to the earliest record available in the database.

**WQX (EPA)** - Formerly the STORET database, this is a data warehouse for water quality, biological, and physical data used by state environmental agencies, the EPA, other federal agencies, universities, private citizens, and others. WQX (EPA) is updated weekly on Thursday evening. Data recently added to WQX (EPA) may not be immediately accessible through the WQP. Data are available for each location dating back to the earliest record available in the database. Throughout the website, STORET and WQX are used interchangeably to refer to the WQX data warehouse.

### **Explanation of portal search parameters**

The WQP can be searched through three different search options:

1. ***Location parameters***
2. ***Site parameters***
3. ***Sampling parameters***

#### **LOCATION PARAMETERS**
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Expand Parameters</summary>

***Country*** - Use the **country window** to select one or multiple ***countries*** represented in the database. Parentheses after each country represent which database(s) it is represented in. 

> *Web Services Request:* Countries can be directly entered into the URL through their [FIPS country code](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub10-4.pdf). For the United States: ```#countrycode=US```

***State*** - Use the **state window** to select one or multiple ***states***. Parentheses after each state represent which database(s) it is represented in.

> *Web Services Request:* States can be directly entered into the URL through their [FIPS state code](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub5-2.pdf). For Iowa and Arizona: ```#statecode=US%3A04&statecode=US%3A19```

***County*** - Use the **county window** to select one or multiple ***counties*** from the selected state(s). Parentheses after each county represent which database(s) it is represented in.

> *Web Services Request:* Counties can be directly entered into the URL through their [FIPS county code](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub6-4.pdf). For Adams and Clay counties in Iowa: ```#countycode=US%3A19%3A003&countycode=US%3A19%3A041```

***Point Location*** - Enter *latitude* and *longitude* (**decimal degrees** referenced to NAD83), and *radial distance* (**miles**) to create a ***search area***. Longitudes in the western hemisphere begin with a negative sign. Many stations outside the continental US do not have latitude and longitude referenced to NAD83 and cannot be found using these parameters.

> *Example:* 20 miles from latitude 46.12 degrees N, longitude 89.15 degrees W would be entered as:
> * Distance: 20
> * Latitude: 46.12
> * Longitude: -89.15

***Site Type***  - ***Site type*** indicates a *natural* or *human-made* feature affecting the hydrologic conditions measured at a site. Use the **site type window** to select one or multiple site types. Parentheses after each site type represent which database(s) it is represented in. ***Table 1*** includes a definition for each available site type.

| **Aggregate groundwater use *(NWIS, STORET)***  | An aggregate groundwater site type is used when it is not possible or practical to describe the specific sites as springs or as any type of well including 'multiple wells', or when water-use information is only available for the aggregate. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Aggregate surface-water-use *(NWIS, STORET)*** | An aggregate surface-water site type is used when it is not possible or practical to describe the specific sites as diversions, outfalls, or land application sites, or when water-use information is only available for the aggregate. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Aggregate water use establishment *(NWIS)*** | An aggregate class of water-using establishments or individuals that are associated with a specific geographic location and water-use category, such as all the industrial users located within a county. Identified using the national water-use category code and optionally classified using the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code or North American Classification System (NAICS) Code. Used when specific information needed to create sites for the individual facilities or users is not available, or when it is not desirable to store the site-specific information in the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Atmosphere**                             | A site established primarily to measure meteorological properties or atmospheric deposition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Estuary**                                | A coastal inlet of the sea or ocean; esp. the mouth of a river, where tide water normally mixes with stream water (modified, Webster). Salinity in estuaries typically ranges from 1 to 25 Practical Salinity Units (psu), as compared oceanic values around 35 psu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Facility**                               | A non-ambient location where environmental measurements are expected to be strongly influenced by current or previous activities of humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Glacier**                                | Body of land ice that consists of recrystallized snow accumulated on the surface of the ground and moves slowly downslope over a period of years or centuries. Since glacial sites move, the lat-long precision for these sites is usually coarse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Lake, Reservoir, Impoundment**           | An inland body of standing fresh or saline water that is generally too deep to permit submerged aquatic vegetation to take root across the entire body (cf: wetland). This site type includes an expanded part of a river, a reservoir behind a dam, and a natural or excavated depression containing a water body without surface-water inlet and/or outlet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Land**                                   | A location on the surface of the earth that is not normally saturated with water. Land sites are appropriate for sampling vegetation, overland flow of water, or measuring land-surface properties such as temperature. (See also: Wetland).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Wetland**                                | Land where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface (Cowardin, December 1979). Wetlands are found from the tundra to the tropics and on every continent except Antarctica. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands may be forested or unforested, and naturally or artificially created. |

***Characteristic Group*** - Groups types of ***environmental measurements***. Use the **characteristic group window** to select one or multiple characteristic groups. Parentheses after each characteristic group represent which database(s) it is represented in. A complete listing of which characteristic matches to which characteristic group [is available for download](http://cdx.epa.gov/wqx/download/DomainValues/Characteristic_CSV.zip).

  <summary>Advanced Results Filters</summary>

***Minimum sampling activities per site*** - Returns only sites where at least a ***minimum number*** of sampling activities have been reported. Use the **minimum number window** to select a value; the default is **1**.

***Minimum result per site*** - Returns only sites where at least a ***minimum number*** of results have been reported. Use the **minimum results window** to select a value; the default is **1**.

***Characteristic*** - Identifies types of ***environmental measurements***. Use the **characteristics window** to select one or multiple characteristics. Parentheses after each characteristic represent which database(s) it is represented in. The names are derived from the WQX (EPA) [Substance Registry System (SRS)](http://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/home/overview/home.do). USGS uses parameter codes for the same purpose and has [associated most parameters to SRS names](http://www.waterqualitydata.us/public_srsnames.jsp).

The nomenclature for WQX (EPA) and USGS characteristics are **not** identical. 
> *Example:* The WQX (EPA) lists each dissolved oxygen characteristic, while the USGS classifies dissolved oxygen under "oxygen". Consequently, users interested in retrieving dissolved oxygen data from both databases must select *"dissolved oxygen"* from WQX (EPA) and *"oxygen"* from the WQP list of characteristics. Selecting *"oxygen"* will return dissolved oxygen results from the USGS **and** all WQX (EPA) results relating to free gaseous oxygen. 

Small differences in naming may cause chemically identical characteristics to be listed under different names or names that are formatted differently. 
> *Example:* *1,4-dichlorobenzene* may be listed as *"1,4-dichlorobenzene"*, *"p-dichlorobenzene"*, or *both*. A user desiring all *1,4-dichlorobenzene* data would need to select **both** names (and variants thereof) to retrieve the results.

***Project ID*** - Uniquely identifies a ***data collection project***. Use the **project ID window** to select one or multiple project IDs. Parentheses after each project ID represent which database it is represented in.

The Water Quality Portal only provides discrete monitoring data. To see USGS long-term flow monitoring sites, click the layer picker on the upper right and toggle on "NWIS (USGS) Stream Gages". These gage locations are based on the [GAGES-II dataset](http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml), which only runs through 2009. Some gages are now discontinued and other gage data may be more accurate.

### **Explanation of data retrievals**

**Data Profiles**

There are hundreds of different *data elements* in the WQX 3.0 schema, which would make downloading all of them in a single file challenging to use and time-consuming to download. To make it easier for users to obtain only the subset of data elements in which they are interested, the data are grouped according to the type of data they describe, such as physical/chemical results data and metadata. These data elements grouped together for download are called Profiles. Some Profiles contain only metadata (e.g. site data or project data), while some contain results-level data, such as the ‘Sample Results’ Profiles. The results-level Profiles were designed to include the core data and metadata required for many common use cases such that additional Profiles are not required; however, each Profile contains a core set of data elements that enable joining individual tables together if needed. **Note**: For users who are interested in obtaining every bit of data for a particular site or group of sites, it may be necessary to download multiple Profiles.

Water monitoring data is delivered in a format and nomenclature defined by the [WQX-Outbound Schema](https://www.exchangenetwork.net/schema/WQX/3/WQX_DET_v3.0.xls). 

Under *"DOWNLOAD DATA"*, the data can be retrieved in the following formats:

* Organization Data
* [Site Data Only](#table-4-site-data-only-result-retrieval-metadata)
* [Project Data](/#table-5-project-data-only-result-retrieval-metadata)*
* [Project Monitoring Location Weighting](#table-6-project-monitoring-location-weighting-result-retrieval-metadata)*
* [Sample Results (Physical/Chemical)](#table-7-sample-results-physicalchemical-result-retrieval-metadata)
* [Sample Results (Biological)](#table-8-sample-results-biological-result-retrieval-metadata)
* [Sample Results (Narrow)](#table-9-sample-results-narrow-result-retrieval-metadata)
* [Sampling Activity](#table-10-sampling-activity-result-retrieval-metadata)*
